A simple but extremely quick binning algorithm for weighted 3D datasets.

Build by typing "make"

Build as a python module with the usual:
`python setup.py develop`

The library https://github.com/RBrearton/RSMapper depends on this library. If
you want to build this module to get RSMapper working, then the
`python setup.py develop`
command should work just fine for you.
